# LyricSync

Welcome to LyricSync. A full-stack application which allows its user to save the lyrics to their favourite songs. Collections can be created where a set of songs can be compiled and saved. Additionally, the translation of foreign songs can be inputted manually.

This full-stack application utilises React for the front-end, paired with Drizzle and SQLite on the backend, with TypeScript as the primary language across the entire stack.

## About

### Background

This project was created by [moa-ha](https://github.com/moa-ha) and [haruka-ogino](https://github.com/haruka-ogino) after completing a software development bootcamp. The goal of the project is to consolidate their learnings and collaboratively problem-solve while building a fully functional full-stack application.

### Learning Goals

The project aims to consolidate knowledge in various areas including React components, RESTful APIs, relational databases, authentication and authorisation, and integration with external APIs.

## Functionality goals

### MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

CRUD Operations:
* read, create, edit and delete collections
* read, create, edit and delete songs and their respective lyrics
* when reading lyrics, have different options of translation display:
    - complete lyrics side by side
    - line by line

AUTH:
* log in functionality
* authorisation - control CRUD operations according to each user



### Stretch Goals

* drag-n-drop items in a collection
* support romanisation for languages using a different alphabets/characters
